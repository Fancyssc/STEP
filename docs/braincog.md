# BrainCog 
## Introduction
**[BrainCog](https://github.com/BrainCog-X/Brain-Cog)** is a required installation package for all tasks in this benchmark. It provides a rich variety of neuron types, supports direct training of SNNs, and is compatible with brain simulation tasks. Although this framework was initially designed with low coupling in mind to accommodate other platforms such as **SpikingJelly** and **BrainPy**, we still adopt BrainCog as the baseline and recommend users to utilize it
