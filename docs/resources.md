As a benchmark project, we aim to keep the work open; therefore, we will release as much data as possible under open source.

## Experiment Result & Analysis
Our experimental results can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Fancyssc/STEP/blob/main/cls/Results.md).

The analysis based on these results can be found in the paper available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11151). If youâ€™re interested, or if our research proves helpful to your work, you might consider citing it.

## Checkpoints
For the main experiments presented in the paper, we have uploaded the official checkpoints, logs, and configuration files to [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/Fancysean/STEP). You can download the corresponding materials from there.
